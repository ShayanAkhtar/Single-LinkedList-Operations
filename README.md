# Single Linked List Operations

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates various operations on a single linked list. The program allows users to create a linked list, perform insertions, deletions, updates, swaps, copy values, find values, and display the linked list.

## Program Features

- **Create List**: Allows users to create a linked list by specifying the number of nodes and their values.
- **Display**: Prints the values of the linked list.
- **Insertion**: Provides options for inserting nodes at the beginning, end, or specific locations in the linked list.
- **Deletion**: Offers options for deleting nodes from the beginning, end, or specific locations in the linked list.
- **Update**: Allows users to update node values based on either the current value or the location in the linked list.
- **Swap**: Enables users to swap node values based on either the current value or the location in the linked list.
- **Copy**: Allows users to copy a node value from one location to another in the linked list.
- **Find**: Finds and displays the location(s) of a specific value in the linked list.

## Getting Started

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations on the linked list.

## Usage

The program presents a menu with options to create a list, perform insertions, deletions, updates, swaps, copy values, find values, and display the linked list. Users can select an option by entering the corresponding number.
